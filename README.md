## Project Motivation
I am particularly interested in user interface and front-end visual design. Through this project, I explored fundamental UI principles such as color coordination, font selection, and layout structure.
Although this is a lightweight project, it serves as a complete and representative example in my portfolio, demonstrating my understanding of the web development process and structural logic.
